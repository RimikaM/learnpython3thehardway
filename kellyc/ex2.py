# to the left is an octothorpe. octothorpe is a really cool word

print('It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.') # comments can also be placed here

# comments are a good way to disable code you don't want to run
# print("I'm broken - don\'t print me")

print('Not all #s make for comments')
