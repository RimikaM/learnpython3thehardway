# A visit to the supermarket

# You decide to do some grocery shopping so head to the store. Did you remember to bring your reusable grocery bags? (If no, tell the customer they are a monster at end-of-game/checkout)

# You head to the produce department to get ingredients for a salad. What sort of greens do you get, kale or red-leaf lettuce? (If kale, say that just as they are about to grab the last bunch, a hipster snags it. What do you do? a) say something snarky and grab baby spinach instead. b) remember that this is just a game, punch the hipster out and take the kale c) compliment the hipster on their taste in pocketwatches and grab the red-leaf lettuce instead. If red-leaf, nothing eventful happens.

# You've got a craving for a Klondike bar, so you head to the frozen section. In the way is an Abdominable snowman. What do you do? a) Laugh at it and say "I'm not real, this is just your dream." b) Ask it whether it whether you should go with the crunchy chocolate shelled Klondike bars or stick with the original. (It replies, go with the original. Classic!) c) Tackle the bear and tie it up. (Afterwards, you take your dream journal out of your bag and make a line through an item on your bucket list.)

# What a weird day you are having! There was something else on your list, but now you can't find it. It was just in your hand! Do you a) drop your basket in the aisle and leave. You're lost without a list. b) resign yourself to the fact that you just have to buy one of everything in the store, so you go back to the front to exchange your basket for a cart c) Head to the bakery. You vaguely remember what else you need and the smell of baked goods always helps to stir your memory. d) Dump your bag out on the floor and dig around until you find it.

# What else do you need? Cereal, dishwashing detergent, or ground beef?

# If ground beef, encounter scene where you have to decide how lean.
# If cereal, encounter aisle full of cereal box characters come to life.
# if dishwashing detergent, have difficulty finding it and get lost in store trying to find an attendant (worse outcome of whole game is hidden in this option.)

# You make your way to the front. All the items you've acquired are in your cart, aka an array. The array is checked for the characters you encountered, who may have snuck into your basket/car (shrunken, of course). If found, the cashier calls the manager over. The manager then checks and if they are the cereal characters or the snowman, says "No problem here!" and then "good riddance" under his breath as he walks away. If it's the hipster, the manager says, "You just had to have the kale, huh? You should let him go. He is a person too." You can let him go and continue checking out, or refuse and run.

# The cashier gives you a random amount (formatted as USD) to pay and you a) pay in pennies or b) pay with a card.

# To be continued...
